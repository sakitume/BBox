## Motor mounts
Regardless of the BBox variant you wish to build, all BBox printers use the same A/B motor mounts.
Each mount sits at the back of the frame and places its motor on the outside of the frame. The screw
holes for the motor are slotted so that belt tension for a motor can be adjusted.
